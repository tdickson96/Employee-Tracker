## Employee Tracker

## Goals

I wanted this application to use Node, Inquirer, Sequelize, and MySQL2 to demonstrate my understanding of databases. Particularly, I wanted the user to be able to update, add, and remove information on their employees through the command-line interface. 

## User Story

As a business owner, I wanted to keep track of my company's departments, roles, and employees with a simple command-line prompter.
